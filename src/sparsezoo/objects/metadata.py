    Metadata to describe a model as stored in the sparsezoo

        e.g. cv, nlp
    :param sub_domain: The sub domain of the model the object belongs to;
        e.g. classification, segmentation
    :param architecture: The architecture of the model the object belongs to;
        e.g. resnet_v1, mobilenet_v1
    :param sub_architecture: The sub architecture (scaling factor) of the model
        the object belongs to; e.g. 50, 101, 152
    :param framework: The framework the model the object belongs to was trained on;
        e.g. pytorch, tensorflow
    :param repo: The source repo for the model the object belongs to;
        e.g. sparseml, torchvision
    :param dataset: The dataset the model the object belongs to was trained on;
        e.g. imagenet, cifar10
    :param training_scheme: The training scheme used on the model the object
        belongs to if any; e.g. augmented
    :param sparse_name: The name describing the sparsification of the model
        the object belongs to, e.g. base, pruned, pruned_quant
    :param sparse_category: The degree of sparsification of the model the object
        belongs to; e.g. none, conservative (~100% baseline metric),
        moderate (>=99% baseline metric), aggressive (<99% baseline metric)
    :param sparse_target: The deployment target of sparsification of the model
        the object belongs to; e.g. edge, deepsparse, deepsparse_throughput, gpu
    :param release_version: The sparsezoo release version for the model
    :param model_id: The id for the model as stored in the cloud
    :param base_model: The id of the base model as stored in the cloud
    :param user_id: The id of the user who uploaded the model as stored in the cloud
