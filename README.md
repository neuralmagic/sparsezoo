## Overview

SparseZoo is a constantly-growing repository of highly sparse and sparse-quantized models with matching sparsification recipes for neural networks. 
It simplifies and accelerates your time-to-value in building performant deep learning models with a collection of inference-sparsified models and recipes to prototype from.

Available via API and hosted in the cloud, the SparseZoo contains both baseline and models sparsified to different degrees of inference performance vs. baseline loss recovery. 
Recipe-driven approaches built around sparsification algorithms allow you to take the models as given, transfer-learn from the models onto private datasets, or transfer the recipes to your architectures.

This repository contains the Python API code to handle the connection and authentication to the cloud.


## Sparsification

Sparsification is the process of taking a trained deep learning model and removing redundant information from the overprecise and over-parameterized network resulting in a faster and smaller model.
Techniques for sparsification are all encompassing including everything from inducing sparsity using [pruning](https://neuralmagic.com/blog/pruning-overview/) and [quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07061) to enabling naturally occurring sparsity using [activation sparsity](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/kurtz20a.html) or [winograd/FFT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.09308). 
When implemented correctly, these techniques result in significantly more performant and smaller models with limited to no effect on the baseline metrics.
For example, pruning plus quantization can give noticeable improvements in performance while recovering to nearly the same baseline accuracy.

The Deep Sparse product suite builds on top of sparsification enabling you to easily apply the techniques to your datasets and models using recipe-driven approaches.
Recipes encode the directions for how to sparsify a model into a simple, easily editable format.
- Download a sparsification recipe and sparsified model from the [SparseZoo](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparsezoo).
- Alternatively, create a recipe for your model using [Sparsify](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparsify).
- Apply your recipe with only a few lines of code using [SparseML](https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparseml).
- Finally, for GPU-level performance on CPUs, deploy your sparse-quantized model with the [DeepSparse Engine](https://github.com/neuralmagic/deepsparse).

## Quick Tour

Each model in the SparseZoo has a specific stub that identifies it. The stubs are made up of the following structure:

`DOMAIN/SUB_DOMAIN/ARCHITECTURE{-SUB_ARCHITECTURE}/FRAMEWORK/REPO/DATASET{-TRAINING_SCHEME}/SPARSE_NAME-SPARSE_CATEGORY-{SPARSE_TARGET}`

The properties within each model stub are defined as the following:

The contents of each model are made up of the following:

- model.md: The model card containing metadata, descriptions, and information for the model.
- model.onnx: The [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) representation of the model's graph.
- model.onnx.tar.gz: A compressed format for the ONNX file. 
    Currently ONNX does not support sparse tensors and quantized sparse tensors well for compression.
- [FRAMEWORK]/model.[EXTENSION]: The native ML framework file(s) for the model in which it was originally trained.
    Such as PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow V1
- recipes/original.[md|yaml]: The original sparsification recipe used to create the model.
- recipes/[NAME].[md|yaml]: Additional sparsification recipes that can be used with the model such as transfer learning.
- sample-originals: The original sample data without any preprocessing for use with the model.
- sample-inputs: The sample data after pre processing for use with the model.
- sample-outputs: The outputs after running the sample inputs through the model.
- sample-labels: The labels that classify the sample inputs.

### Python APIS

The Python APIs respect this format enabling you to search and download models. Some code examples are given below.

#### Searching the Zoo

```python
from sparsezoo import Zoo

models = Zoo.search_models(domain="cv", sub_domain="classification")
print(models)
```

#### Common Models

```python
from sparsezoo.models.classification import resnet_50

model = resnet_50()
model.download()

print(model.onnx_file.downloaded_path())
```

#### Searching Optimized Versions

```python
from sparsezoo import Zoo
from sparsezoo.models.classification import resnet_50

search_model = resnet_50()
sparse_models = Zoo.search_sparse_models(search_model)

print(sparse_models)
```

### Console Scripts

In addition to the Python APIs, a console script entry point is installed with the package `sparsezoo`.
This enables easy interaction straight from your console/terminal.
Note, for some environments the console scripts cannot install properly.
If this happens for your system and the sparsezoo command is not available, 
`https://github.com/neuralmagic/sparsezoo/blob/main/scripts/sparsezoo.py` may be used in its place.

```shell script
sparsezoo -h
```
